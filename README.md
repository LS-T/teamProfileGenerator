# Team Profile Generator


# Description

 This command line application allows a user to create their own team of managers, interns, and engineers. Through the use of inquirer to capture user input, a user can create their own team by answering the questions they are prompted to. Once a user gets through all of the questions, the user is given a rendered html page with all the information they inputted for each role.
